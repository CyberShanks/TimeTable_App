# TimeTable_App
TimeTable App

Redo
-> Make a TimeRanges Class
Class will have methods like to_String(), explode(), join(), etc.
Class will have attributes such as one, half, multi
Makes the timeranges smarter and a lot more powerful. 

Next Steps
1. Get current time and highlight the time-range div that corresponds to that time
2. Add a DB where the entire timetable is stored for a day. The DB only stores Timetable of 7 days (1 week)
3. Add totals displays which tell you how many hours of a activity has been done in a day, week, month, year
4. Add checkbox next to all the actions which can be ticked to signify that they have been completed
5. **Add a mobile version of the App which does not allow edits, but allows you to see the timetable and totals
